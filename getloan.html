        <p style="margin-left: 7%; margin-right: 7%;">These days, it's becoming commonplace
             for people to borrow loans when necessities arise. It is fast becoming a 
             ubiquitous practice to borrow a personal loan to fulfill a variety of needs
              and to meet a diverse set of milestones such as purchasing a new car, 
              financing a house purchase, covering education costs, or paying emergency
               medical bills. However, before one can apply for a personal loan, it is crucial
                that they understand the agreements, terms, and conditions that apply to the loan in question.</p>

       <h1 class="big-text" style="text-align: center;">Important constituents of a personal loan agreement form</h1>
       <p style="margin-left: 7%;">Generally, loan agreement forms include:</p>
       <ul style="margin-left: 20%;">
        <ol type="1">
        <li>
            Covenant 
        </li>
        <li>Collateral value</li>
        <li>The interest rate levied</li>
        <li>Duration within which the loan has to be repaid completely</li>
       <li>Terms of default</li>
       <li>Collection terms in the case of default of a loan</li>
       </ol> 
       </ul>
       <h1 class="big-text" style="text-align: center;">Terms and Conditions</h1>
       <p style="margin-left: 7%;">The terms and conditions of a loan agreement will revolve around the following points:
       </p>
         <ul style="margin-left:8%; margin-right: 10%;">
        <li>
            <b>Fees and Charges:</b> These terms would deal with the applicable fees
             and charges levied by your loan provider. They can include processing fees,
              convenience charges, annual maintenance charges, bounce charges, and penal
               interest. Ensure that you understand all applicable fees and charges thoroughly before undertaking a loan.
        </li>
        <li>
           <b> Interest:</b> The terms and conditions here would pertain to the rate
            of interest charged by the loan provider. As per the stipulated due date, 
            you would be required to furnish the interest payable.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Repayment:</b> This would stipulate the terms and conditions concerning 
            the repayment of your personal loan. The EMI (Equated Monthly Installments)
             due every month is calculated by taking into account your interest rate,
              the repayment tenure and your loan amount.
        </li>
        <li>
           <b> Default:</b>If the borrower fails to pay the amount due on the relevant
            due dates, they would be defaulting on their payments. In such cases, the loan
             provider would generally follow-up by way of text or call and, at certain times, may levy a penalty.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Foreclosure:</b> When an individual is able to repay all their dues
             earlier than warranted, this is known as the foreclosure of a personal
              loan account. While certain loan providers would levy charges on foreclosure, 
              others opt not to do so. For instance, the personal loan available on online 
              platforms like Bajaj Markets come with zero foreclosure charges.
